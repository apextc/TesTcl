## Contributing

Contributions are very welcomed. There are just a few things to remember:

 - Run tests against JTcl since the custom iRule extensions have only been implemented in that Tcl implementation
    - Run _examples.sh_ and _tests.sh_ or their Windows equivalents, and verify output
 - Please follow existing coding style and indentation (2 spaces for tabs)
 - Add new example or test when appropriate
 - Add or update documentation when necessary and make sure it is correct (as in test it)
